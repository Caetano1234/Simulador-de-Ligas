# Simulador de Ligas

## How it started out?

I'm a person that likes soccer. So, this project started as a challenge for myself to do something good out JavaScript, and I think I finally did.
It started out as a "Soccer Player Carreer Simulator", but I noticed that it was really hard to do that, so I changed to a "Multiple Leagues Simulator".

## How it works?

The leagues, the teams and their strength are real-life based (even though I made a system for creating players that aren't real), and you'll see that. I created that trying to simulate how the leagues change. Maybe, later, I should try adding random actions (as a businessperson buys a team or some team being punished by not following financial fair play rules), but not now.
